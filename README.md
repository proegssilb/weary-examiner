An implementation of Bret Victor's Seeing Space.

This implementation is broken into three pieces, which have not been fully structured yet:

* SensorServer: A repository for synchronized Time-Series data grouped into sessions.
* GlClient: A program that collects, logs, displays, and searches time-series data.
